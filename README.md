# Template
Basic template for setting up a new story

## Setup a new project

- Install `degit` once

```
npm install -g degit
```

There are several branches in this project that contain similar versions of the
template with for different frameworks


### Minimal template

`degit nzherald/template`

### Batteries included template

This template pulls in d3, d3-jetpack, jquery & lodash. It uses a class
based template for components.

`degit nzherald/template#batteries-included`

### ObservableHQ template

`degit nzherald/template#observable`


## Template features




## Installation
Webpack dev server should be ready to go as soon as packages are installed.
```
npm install
npm start
```


## Run modes
```
npm run [option]
```
**start**: Runs dev server with barebone template
**analyse**: Builds and runs bundle-analysis tools
**release**: Builds and pushes bundle files to homepage specified in package.json - embed details will be in `dist/zen.txt`
**livetest**: Builds and pushes bundle files to https://insights.nzherald.co.nz/app/livetest, which can be viewed at https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12234834

## Embedding in an article

To embed an interactive within an article it is necessary to insert something similar to

    <div class='nzh-datavis' id='nzh-datavis-root'></div>

The id can be varied - the class needs to always be `nzh-datavis`

The `dist/zen.txt` will contain embed links for `embed.css`, `prelaunch_v2.js`, and `embed.js`.
These should be placed in the article's _raw footer_ and they only need to be included once.

The actual interactive is initiated with a script like

    <script defer>window.onload = function () { new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root", {}) }</script>

Make sure that the id matches the id of the div inserted into the article.

### Embedding multiple visualisations

The easiest way to embed multiple visualistions is to pass configuration parameters in a dictionary
as the second argument to Main and to insert multiple divs into the article with different ids e.g.

    <script defer>window.onload = function () { 
        new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root", {}) 
        new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root__2", {chart: 2}) 
    } </script>

Obviously your interactive needs to handle the `chart` arguent and render something different to the
default view.

Another approach is to use a function name other than `Main` and then call the different functions.
This approach is necessary if you want to include interactives from multiple projects in one
article.


### Utiilty features

There are 3 useful functions in `src/lib/util.js` 

The master template is a fully functioning example of all of these functions.

#### `nzhconsole`

Within the Herald site `console.log` is redirected to an array of strings that can be viewed at
`console.messages` - this is generally fine for checking an interactive has rendered. But because
the messages are strings it is sometime insufficient for resolving problems - especially if those
problems require viewing an object. The function `nzhconsole` logs its arguments to the console
regardless of where the code is running.


#### `appWarn`

In the NZH mobile app interactives run within their own ReactNativeWebView - this means that some of
the features we like to use - primarily stick positioning - are unavailable.

To include a prompt ro redirect to an actual browser window use the appWarn argument:


    new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root", { appWarn: 12234834 }) 

where the argument is the zen id of the article - this will generate a url within the "New Zealand"
section of the Herald, include a `category` argument if you want another vertical e.g. 

    new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root", { appWarn: 12234834, category: "business" }) 

#### `setupScrolly`

_Scrolly-telling_ is a common way of making visualisations more accessible to readers. This
function provides easy integration of a basic scrolly-telling approach with an article. A full-blown
scrolly-telling article would require further customisation or a different approach.

This scrolly telling approach just grabs each embedded interactive element and makes it sticky for
the specified number of paragraphs. There is also the option to pass a callback which will be called
whenever a given paragraph is focussed. The `elm` branch includes a working example of using this
callback in `root.js` - the callback code is all JS not Elm.


    <script defer>window.onload = function () { 
        new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root", { appWarn: 12234834 }) 
        new window.Main("#nzh-datavis-root2", {chart: "mƒÅori", setupScrolly: [4, 2]}) 
    }</script>

To use this pass the `setupScrolly` argument to the last embed - the additional parameters are just
a list of the number of paragraphs that the graphic should be sticky for - so in this case
4 paragraphs after the first graphic and 2 after the second.
